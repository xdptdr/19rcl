# 19rcl

This project displays on the same page a widget from [Belle](http://nikgraf.github.io/belle/#/?_k=7mu5b3), [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com/#/), [Elemental UI](http://elemental-ui.com/), [React Desktop](http://reactdesktop.js.org/demo/), [Rebass](http://jxnblk.com/rebass/), [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html), [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), [React Widgets](http://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/docs/#/?_k=nf6my5), [MUI](https://www.muicss.com/docs/v1/example-layouts/responsive-side-menu).

[David Wells](https://github.com/davidwells) listed [19 Open Source React Component Libraries](http://davidwells.io/19-open-source-react-component-libraries-to-use-in-your-next-project/).

He also made a nice presentation at [AtTheFrontend 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwofAAThsx0), which is where I found the link to the list.

I could only use 9 of the libraries in the list.

The other tens libraries in the list are not included because I failed to display a component from them correclty.

The project itself was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
